         <h3> Me in 238 words </h3>
         <p> Hi, my name is Khalila and welcome to my personal internet hub. I'm a self-proclaimed jane-of-all trades having worked in various aspects of writing, editing, design, project coordination, and event planning.  The three common denominators in everything I've done is the strong desire to make things real, make things pretty, and make things happen. My highly analytical, data-driven, planning left brain and my creative dynamic right brain have come to a truce along the fact that I am a methodical creative problem solver. 
Every aspect of the real, pretty, and happen trifecta involves creative problem solving that comes with making something that is real by taking into account everyday user uses and considerations, pretty, keeping the design as approachable and inviting as the content should be, and bringing it all together to make it happen however possible because, well, otherwise, what's the point. I've worked in a variety of roles and in every one
</p>
<p>
So, what does this all mean? I highly analytical, always asking questions, and a planner, keeping my checklist in hand, but I can easily throw the checklists aside when they no longer serve the purpose or it just needs to get done. I 
especially those that get to the heart of an issue.
facilitated by a collaborative take, be it with a client or project team, I'm a team player but know how to get things done. </p>
<p>Whew, now 238 words later...if you haven't read enough about me, i've got another 500 words for you in the about page. Otherwise, please feel free to peruse my work or resume at will. I'm also always available for questions or further discussions via the handy contact page.
         </p>

         <h3> Work Approach </h3>
         <h4>Make it Real</h4> <p>Here's where it starts and where it should always start. With the real of everyday, be it the content, audience, or goal. <a href="work.html">More</a>... <!-- Real is the information you want to convey, to the audience you want to convey it to, to attain the you created when you created it. Real is not the same for everyone or for every project, so defining what it is a ever-changing and often challenging process. </p> -->
   <h4>Make it Pretty</h4> <!--Some may call this design but, for many, the term design is too intimidating. Everybody who creates and presents information in any form is a designer in their own right. However, the level of success usually involves a set of skills that result in the effectiveness of the . --> <p> Effective and functional design makes the information . It could be bad, or good, but it should be pretty. <a href="work.html">More</a>... </p>
<h4>Make it Happen</h4> <p> <!--The real and the pretty interact with each in a strange dance that one is always informing the other. They should be thought of together and put together. --> Sometimes this gets lost along the way to the detriment of one or the other. It doesn't have to be this way. <!--With the right mindset and collaborations, it can happen to create and distribute a finished product where one feeds into the other and you can't imagine it another way. --><a href="work.html">More</a>... 

</p>
<h4>Repeat</h4>
<p> Life is not stagnant and neither is the information or design trends that inform our everyday lives. <!-- Real changes as much as it needs to and because they are often a unite, so too can design. -->Everything evolves so evaluations must be made to make sure that the product is real and pretty in the now.</p>
