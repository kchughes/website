         <h3> Me in 147 words </h3>
         <p> Hi, my name is Khalila and welcome to my personal internet hub. I like to call myself a jane-of-all trades because I've worked in project coordination, writing, editing, design, administrative support, and event planning, not to mention having a penchant for languages, a background in fashion design, and a pending degree in technical communication. 
</p>
<p>
The three common denominators in everything I've done are the strong desire and active commitment to make things real, make things pretty, and make things happen. Every aspect of the “real”, “pretty”, and “happen” trifecta involves the collaborative and independent creative problem solving that I thrive on: making something that is real by taking into account meaningful everyday user experiences, making something pretty by keeping the design as approachable and inviting as the content should be, and bringing it all together to make it happen however possible because, well, otherwise, what's the point? 
</p>

<p>
<br />Whew, now 147 words later...if you haven't read enough about me, I've got another 500 words for you in the about page. Otherwise, please feel free to peruse my work or resume at will. I'm also always available for questions or conversation via any of the contact methods conveniently located at the bottom of every page.
</p>

         <div class="box">
 <h4>Make it Real</h4> <p>Here's where it starts and where it should always start. With the real of the everyday experience, whether it's the content, audience, or goal. <a href="work.html">More</a>... <!-- Real is the information you want to convey, to the audience you want to convey it to, to attain the you created when you created it. Real is not the same for everyone or for every project, so defining what it is a ever-changing and often challenging process. </p> -->

      <div class="box">
   <h4>Make it Pretty</h4> <!--Some may call this design but, for many, the term design is too intimidating. Everybody who creates and presents information in any form is a designer in their own right. However, the level of success usually involves a set of skills that result in the effectiveness of the . --> <p> Effective and functional design makes information accessible and inviting, usually without appearing to do so. It could be good, or not so good, but it should be always pretty. <a href="work.html">More</a>... </p>
   </div>
   <div class="box">
<h4>Make it Happen</h4> <p> <!--The real and the pretty interact with each in a strange dance that one is always informing the other. They should be thought of together and put together. --> Sometimes in the nitty gritty of figuring out the real, or during the nitpicking of making it pretty, it is easy to forget that the two interact with and inform each other to come together and create something great.<!--Sometimes this gets lost along the way to the detriment of one or the other. It doesn't have to be this way. With the right mindset and collaborations, it can happen to create and distribute a finished product where one feeds into the other and you can't imagine it another way. --><a href="work.html"> More</a>... 

</p>
</div>
<!-- <h4>Repeat</h4>
<p> Life is not stagnant and neither is the information or design trends that inform our everyday lives.  Real changes as much as it needs to and because they are often a unite, so too can design. Everything evolves so evaluations must be made to make sure that the product is real and pretty in the now.</p> -->
