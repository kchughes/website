         <h3> Me in 147 words </h3>
         <p> Hi, my name is Khalila and welcome to my personal internet hub. I like to call myself a jane-of-all trades because I've worked in project coordination, writing, editing, design, administrative support, and event planning, not to mention having a penchant for languages, a background in fashion design, and a pending degree in technical communication. 
</p>
<p>
The three common denominators in everything I've done are the strong desire and active commitment to make things real, make things pretty, and make things happen. Every aspect of the “real”, “pretty”, and “happen” trifecta involves the collaborative and independent creative problem solving that I thrive on: making something that is real by taking into account meaningful everyday user experiences, making something pretty by keeping the design as approachable and inviting as the content should be, and bringing it all together to make it happen however possible because, well, otherwise, what's the point? 
</p>

<p>
<br />Whew, now 147 words later...if you haven't read enough about me, I've got another 201 words for you in the <a href="about.html">about</a> page. Otherwise, please feel free to peruse some of <a href="work.html">my work</a>. I'm also always available for questions or conversation via any of the contact methods conveniently located at the bottom of every page.

<!-- <h4>Repeat</h4>
<p> Life is not stagnant and neither is the information or design trends that inform our everyday lives.  Real changes as much as it needs to and because they are often a unite, so too can design. Everything evolves so evaluations must be made to make sure that the product is real and pretty in the now.</p> -->
